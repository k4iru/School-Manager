# School Management System

This was a final project for my 2nd year Software Engineering class. 

# The Problem 

In groups of 4, we were tasked with designing a management system where you could log in as either an Admin, Instructor, or Student, after which you would be presented with the available commands such as adding students to a class or updating grades

# What I Learned 

This was the largest project I've ever done. I learned a lot about how to work efficiently with others, as well as various design styles. My next step would be to create a GUI for the application.

# How to Run 

1. Clone the repo and open the project in Eclipse
2. Run the test harness
